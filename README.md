# Dijkstra

Semester project carried out as part of the Computer Programming Basics classes. The subject of the project was to create a program to find the shortest paths between a given graph vertex and all other vertices, which is done by implementing the Dijkstra algorithm. 

### How to run
#### Input files
- graph file;
- vertices file.

```
djikstra.exe -g graph.txt -w verticies.txt -o output.txt
```

Routes with the minimum length for the given vertices are saved in the result file.
